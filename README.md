# WebScraping
Web Scraping in python using Beautiful Soup

In this application we scrape the website [TimesJob](https://www.timesjobs.com/) for 'recently posted' jobs related to the skill 'Python'. Additionally, the jobs are filtered on the basis of the skills that the user is not familiar with. Finally the results are stored in separate txt files denoting the jobs that meet the criterion.

## Libraries to be downloaded
### BeautifulSoup
 ```
 $ pip install beautifulsoup4
 ```
 ### Requests
 ```
 $ pip install requests
```

## Important:
Please download the folder along with the python file to run the program smoothly. 
or
Create a folder called 'Posts' in the same location as the python file.
